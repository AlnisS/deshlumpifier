# deshlumpifier

This is not working too well right now, but it basically yells at you when you start to slouch. To use, launch it, hope it doesn't crash, sit in an upright position, and click somewhere in the window to set the upright position (you may click to set this as much as you want). If you start to slouch, it will send a notification to the system tray saying that you are slouching.
